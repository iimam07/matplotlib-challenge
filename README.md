Observations seen from the data include:
-Capomulin had the most mice tested, and Propiva had the least. Because this was to test Capumulin's performance against other drugs, it would make send that it had the most tested
-There was a 51:49 to male to female percentage comparison, so it was very close to being half and half
-Capomulin did not have the lowest final tumor volume, but was close to it.
-There is a significant positive correlation between the mouse weight and average tumor volume
